## About

The penguin notebook is a notebook made to help you live your life a little deft. In the penguin notebook, the "now" is written, and by accumulating it, it becomes a "past", and by repeating this process, a function is provided so that you can always face the "now". In consideration of the ease of writing due to the use of lines, the lines are designed so that they do not interfere with the mind of the person who uses them separately.
We are selling Penguin Notebook on our [shop](https://penguinnote.buyshop.jp/)

## Concept

I think there are "dexterous person" and "clumsy person" in the world. Whether you're forgetful or distracted, I'm one of them. As a person who tends to forget about everyday things, I was bothered by the awareness that I was causing trouble to others and the anxiety that I had no choice but to do so now.

Once I started writing down what I had to do and checking it when it was done. At first, I used to use the back of the copy paper by fastening it with an eye clip. While I was accumulating notes, there were fewer occasions where I forgot what I had to do, and I felt relieved to see that I was alive after seeing so many memos.

I use pens and notebooks every day. Everything you use every day is naturally easy to use. The ruled lines of "penguin note" are carefully designed to make it easy to write down the daily state of mind and thoughts. In addition, "penguin note" discloses all data. This is because we believe it is important for those who want to try "penguin note" to be able to do so right away, and for those who are already using it, to be able to use it anytime and customize it.

Penguins who jump out of a group and jump into the sea from the top of an iceberg are called first penguins. Clumsy people often find new ideas or special skills and shine, but I want "penguin note" to be a notebook to support those "first penguin".
